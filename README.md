<h1>What is Old Dog, New Spells?</h1>
Old Dog, New Spells is a browser extension for D&D Beyond that links old, spellcasting monsters to the new, 2024 versions of their spells.

Previously, old monsters would have links to old versions of spells, meaning you would either need to use outdated spells in your 2024 game, or manually search for the new version.

Now, monsters will link to the updated versions of the spell, greatly increasing the ease of use for Dungeon Masters.
